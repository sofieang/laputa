<h1>The Degree Distribution dialog</h1>

<p>This dialog lets the user inspect the degree distribution of either the current network, or the mean degree distribution of the networks generated during a batch simulation. Since the networks of Laputa are directed, there are three distributions: that of ingoing edges, that of outgoing edges, and the combined sum of these.</p>

<p>Laputa supports fitting these distributions to curves, in order to find statistics of the networks it generates. Since such statistics are often only applied to the tail end of a distribution, a lower cutoff is specifiable through a slider. The <b>Fit</b> button selects the type of curve that best fits at the current cutoff. The specific curves are also selectable through a popup menu. At the moment, Laputa allows fitting the distribution to any of the following probability distribution types:</p>
