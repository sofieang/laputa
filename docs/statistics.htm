<h1>The Statistics window</h1>

  <p>
    The statistics window gives an overview of the results of running a single <a href="batchsimulation.htm>"batch simulation</a>. It shows the following data:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Average E-value over time:</b> The average E-value of the societies in the simulation at each time step. Note that the E-value is calculated for the chosen part of the society, and then the result is averaged over all the trials. The popup menu in the upper right lets the user look at the average E-values of subsets of the society, picked out in terms of their E-value. Thus the <i>Bottom Quintile</i> contains the 20% of the inquirers with the lowest E-value, the <i>Lower Quintile</i> contains the next 20%, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Average E-value:</b> The average E-value of the societies created, at the end of the simulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Average E-value &Delta;:</b> The average of the change in E-value of the societies created, between the start and the end of each simulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Polarisation:</b> The average standard deviation of E-value in the societies created, at the end of the simulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Polarisation &Delta;:</b> The average change in the standard deviation of E-evalue in the societies created, between the start and the end of each simulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Average Bandwagoning %:</b> The percent of all updates where an inquirer's degree of belief has been changed in the opposite direction from her own opinion or inquiry, as a result of communication from others. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Average Bandwagoning Effect:</b> The average difference in what the inquirer's resulting degree of belief would have been without external influence, compared to with it, when such bandwagoning has occured.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b># simulations run:</b> The number of trials in the batch simulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b># steps/simulation:</b> The number of steps each simulation is run, all stages included.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Average # messages sent:</b> The average number of messages sent during each trial.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Average # inquiry results :</b> The average number of inquiry results received during each trial.
  </p>

<p><b>Degrees: </b>Opens the <a href="degreedistributions.htm">Degree Distribution</a> dialog, where the graph-theoretic properties of the generated societies can be studied.</p>

<p><b>Export EValues: </b>Opens the <a href="exportstatistics.htm">Statistics Export</a> dialog, where the exact results of the batch simulation can be saved in a spreadsheet format.</p>

  <p>
    <b>Export Topologies: </b>Opens the <a href="exporttopologies.htm">Topologies Export</a> dialog, from which one can export the network topologies generated in the simulation in Pajek format.
