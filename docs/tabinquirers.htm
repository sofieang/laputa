<h1>The Inquirers tab</h1>

<p>This tab determines the individual properties of each inquirer at the start of the stage. Each property has a <a href="randomdistributions.htm">probability distribution</a> (or in the case of trust, a <a href="metadistributions.htm">metadistribution</a>), and a check box that determines whether to change this property at the start of the stage, or let it stay as it was at the end of the previous stage.
</p>

  <p>The properties that can be modified are those of concrete inquirers, as described in the <a href="inquirers.htm">corresponding page</a>.
