<h1>Simulations</h1>

<p>A simulation is an evolution of a society. These are controlled through the floating window "Simulation". This window contains buttons to step the simulation forward one step at a time as well as to start and stop continuous simulations. The pop-up menu "Log" is used to control what amount of information to display when running a simulation.</p>

<p>When running or stepping simulations, statistics is collected:</p>

<p><b>Time:</b> The number of time steps elapsed since the "Reset" button was last pressed.</p>

<p><b>E-value:</b> The current <a href="evalue">E-value</a> of the society.</p>

<p><b>E-value &Delta; :</b> The change in E-value since the simulation was last reset.</p>

<p><b>Polarisation:</b> The standard deviation in individual E-values in the society.</p>

<p><b>Polarisation &Delta; :</b> The change in the standard deviation in individual E-values in the society since the simulation was last reset.</p>
