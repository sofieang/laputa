<h1>Generating Random Societies</h1>

<p>The interface for this is much the same as that for <a href="batchsimulation.htm">batch simulations</a>, since both require setting a society's properties randomly. Just generating societies does not require stages, however, and the dialog contains only the following tabs:</p>

  <p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tabnetwork.htm">Network</a></li>
<li><a href="tabinquirers.htm">Inquriers</a></li>
<li><a href="tablinks.htm">Links</a></li>
</ul>
  </p>

  <p>As in the batch simulation window, the generate society dialog can be used either to generate new societies, or to change the values of the current society randomly, depending on whether the <i>Create</i> check boxes in the network tab are ticked or not.
</p>

  <p>The inquirers of the generated society will be placed according to their degrees, so that the ones with the highest degree (i.e. incoming and outgoing links) are in the center, and such that inquirers with lower degrees are farther out.</p>
