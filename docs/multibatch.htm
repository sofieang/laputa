<h1>Multibatch Simulations</h1>

<p>A multibatch simulation is a collection of individual batch simulations with varying parameters. Each batch simulation is generated as a linear combination of the four batches (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), or just of the two batches (0, 0) and (0, 1) if the simulation is set to be 1-dimensional rather than 2-dimensional. Small triangular buttons between the <b>Set Batch</b> buttons are used to copy all parameters of one batch to another.</p>

<p>The results of all these simulations are written as an .ods spreadsheet file, containing descriptions of the batches generated, as well as the E-values, E-value &Delta;'s, the polarisation, and the polarisation &Delta;'s obtained from each batch.</p>

 <p>The <b>Preview</b> button allows the user to look at the parameters of the resulting batch simulations. It opens the <a href="batchsimulation.htm">batch simulation</a> dialog in a form that also lets one choose the coordinates of the batch to inspect. Changing parameters in this form of the batch simulation dialog has no effect; it is purely for observation.
