<h1>Exporting Topologies</h1>

<p>When running a batch simulation, Laputa can records a selection of the network topologies generated for further analysis. At the moment, the only format supported is <a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/">Pajek</a>.</p>

<p>The exporter can write a network with weigted edges, or one which is unweighted, which means that all edges included will have weight one. Furthermore, a minimum listen chance can be set for which edges to include; this is useful if one wants to exclude "dead" links, i.e. ones that have very low listen chance and are thus almost never used anyway.</p>

  <p>When exporting topologies generated in a <a href="batchsimulation.htm">batch simulation</a>, it is also possible to choose whether to export the networks as a folder of individual .net files, or as a Pajek .paj project file, which can contain all the networks in a single file.</p>
