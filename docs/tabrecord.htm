<h1>The Record tab</h1>

  <p>In this tab, what data to record during the batch simulation can be adjusted. The reason for doing this is mostly to avoid problems with memory when doing very large simulations. If E-Value data is not recorded, only rudimentary statistics will be available in the <a href="statistics.htm">statistics dialog</a>. If topology is not recorded, it will not be possible to export network topologies from the <a href="exporttopologies.htm">export topologies dialog</a> after the simulation has run.
</p>
 <p>In the accompanying fields, it is possible to change how often data about E-Values and topologies is to be recorded. Raising these values will also lessen the amount of memory Laputa will need to run the simulation.</p>
