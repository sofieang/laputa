<h1>Exporting Statistics</h1>

<p>When running a batch simulation, Laputa records the individual e-values of all inquirers at any time, and for any trial. This data, or a subset of it, can be saved in .ods (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) format.</p>

<p>For each dimension of the spreadsheet, a single variable can be picked. Checking the <b>Average<b> (or <b>Final</b>) button will make Laputa average over that variable, or in case it is time, pick the last moment. Thus averaging over trials will result in a spreadsheet containing the average e-value per inquirer and time, over all the trials made.</p>
