<h1>Simulation Parameters</h1>

<p>These parameters, for links and inquirers, determine how their proprties should be set when the batch simulator creates a new society. For each property, there are three possible settings:</p>

<p><b>Default:</b> the property is set entirely depending on the settings in the Batch Simulation window.</p>

<p><b>Constant:</b> the property does not change randomly at all, i.e. the inquirer/link has the same value in every random society, and does not depend on the settings in the Batch simulation window.</p>

<p><b>Variable:</b> the property varies individually, rather than based on the settings in the Batch simulator. How it is varied is determined by the probability distribution next to the setting knob.</p>

<p>For inquirers, it is also possible to switch on or off whether data from this inquirer should be included in the statistics collected in the simulation window, and in the batch simulator.</p>
