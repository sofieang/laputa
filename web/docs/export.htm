<h1>Exporting Data</h1>

<p>While Laputa contains some rudimentary statistical functions, these are mainly intended to give the user an overview. For serious statistics, it is advisable to export the data collected during a batch simulation and work with it in some program specifically designed for this. Pressing the "Export" button in the statistics window allows this to be done.<p>

<p>Data from a batch simulation is generally saved in a two-dimensional matrix format, where columns are separated by a tab and rows by a carriage return. A dot (.) is used as a decimal separator, regardless of the language of the operating system Laputa is run on. What kind of data is mapped to each dimension is determined by the settigns in the "Statistics to Record" dialog, accessible from the batch simulation window.</p>
