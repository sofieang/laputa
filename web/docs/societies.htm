<h1>Editing Societies</h1>

<p>A society is a collection of inquirers and links between them. There are mainly three tools in Laputa to interact with them. They are accessed by the buttons at the top of the Society window. Each tool can be selected by clicking its button, or by hitting the corresponding number key on the keyboard. Their settings are accessed by right-clicking on the corresponding button.</p>

<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td><img src="icon1up.jpg"></td><td><h4>The Create Inquirer tool</h4></td></tr></table>

<p>This tool adds a new inquirer to the society, at the place clicked at in the society view. This inquirer's properties are set randomly, based on the preferences of the tool.</p>

<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td><img src="icon2up.jpg"></td><td><h4>The Create Link tool</h4></td></tr></table>

<p>This tool allows one to add a link between two inquirers by pressing the left mouse button on the link's source, and then dragging it to the inquirer which is to be its destination. The new link's properties are set randomly, based on the preferences of the tool.</p>

<br>
<table border="0"><tr><td><img src="icon3up.jpg"></td><td><h4>The Selection tool</h4></td></tr></table>

<p>This tool is used to select groups of inquirers and/or links, to facilitate moving, copying, pasting and deleting these. Holding alt (on Mac) or ctrl (on Windows) while moving selected inquirers copies them. Holding shift while clicking on inquirers or links selects or deselects them, without changing the selection status of other links or inquirers. The backspace or delete key removes inquirers or links from the society.<p>

The preferences for this tool can be set to limit what kinds of entities are selectable. For this purpose, an Internal Link is one which is between two inquirers, both of which are selected, and an External Link is one to or from a selected inquirer.</p>
