<h1>Inquirers</h1>

<p>The properties of an inquirer are accessed through the Inquirer Inspector, which is a floating window.</p>

<p><b>Name:</b> An optional name for the inquirer. Does not affect anything except aesthetics.</p>

<p><b>Belief:</b> The current degree of belief the inquirer has in the sentence whose truth-value is investigated.</p>

<p><b>Inquiry Chance:</b> The chance to engage in inquiry each time step.</p>

<p><b>Inquiry Accuracy:</b> The chance to that inquiry gives the correct result (i.e. <i>p</i>) rather than its opposite (i.e. not-<i>p</i>).</p>

<p><b>Inquiry Trust:</b> The trust function that describes how much the inquirer trusts the results of her own inquiry. The accompanying popup menu can be used to set this function to a number of presets, as well as to an arbitrarily specified <a href="randomdistributions.htm">probability distribution</a>. The trust function can also be edited manually by drawing or clicking in the display. A check box allows switching the inquirer's update of trust in view of the results of inquiry on or off.</p>

<p><b>Simulation Parameters:</b> Accesses specific parameters that determine how the inquirer's properties should vary in a batch simulation. These are described in the text <a href="simulationparameters.htm">simulation parameters</a>.
