<h1>Introduction to Laputa</h1>


<P>Laputa is centered around two primary concepts: <a href="inquirers.htm">Inquirers</a> and  <a href="inquirers.htm">Links</a>. A society consists of a set of inquirers, and a set of communicational links between these. Each inquirer determines how she is to update her degree of belief in the face of evidence, and also how she is to find this evidence. The links determine which inquirers can receive information from which, and how this information is handled. Thus, a link to an inquirer can also be seen as an aspect of her investigative behaviour.</P>

<P>Inquirers get information primarily from two sources: their own inquiry and other inquirers. Each time step, they randomly decide what to do, based on their parameters. A <a href="simulation.htm">Simulation</a> is a possible evolution of a society of such inquirers, and a <a href="batchsimulation.htm">Batch Simulation</a> is a collection of such simulations, with varying starting parameters. When a simulation is run, Laputa calculates the <a href="evalue.htm">epistemic value</a> of the result in order to facilitate comparison of the effectiveness of different society structures.</P>

<P>Since batch simulations generate societies randomly, they require specification of <a href="randomdistributions.htm">Probability Distributions</a> that determine the properties of the societies generated. These are referenced by name by Laputa, and while there is a number of default distributions, it is also possible to define new ones.</P>
