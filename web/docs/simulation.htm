<h1>Simulations</h1>

<p>A simulation is an evolution of a society. These are controlled through the floating window "Simulation". This window contains buttons to step the simulation forward one step at a time as well as to start and stop continuous simulations. The pop-up menu "Log" is used to control what amount of information to display when running a simulation.</p>

<p>When running or stepping simulations, statistics is collected:</p>

<p><b>Time:</b> The number of time steps elapsed since the "Reset" button was last pressed.</p>

<p><b>Error avg.:</b> The current average degree of error in the society.</p>

<p><b>Error dev.:</b> The current standard deviation of the degree of error in the society.</p>

<p><b>Error &Delta;:</b> How much the average degree of error has changed since the "Reset" button was last pressed.</p>

<p><b>Trust avg.:</b> The average expected trust for all links in the society (note: trust in inquiry is not included here).</p>

<p><b>Trust &Delta;:</b> How much the average expected trust of all links has changed since the "Reset" button was last pressed.</p>
