Laputa is a program for simulating the epistemological aspects of a society. It allows the user to design different society structures, and run various tests on these.
</p>
<p>
Laputa was initially developed at the department of philosophy, Lund University. It is now open sourced, and released under the GPL. We hope that researchers over the world working in the field of social epistemology will find it useful, and ideally, contribute to its development.
